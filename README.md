# Machine_Learning_Tutorial_Op_Meterology

The Jupyter Notebooks in this repository are created as one of the tasks in my Intership at the North Carolina Institute for Climate Studies. The purpose of these Jupyter notebooks is to assist researchers and scientists in the development of scientific tools and applications  for the study of large amounts of meteorological data on open-source cloud platforms.
