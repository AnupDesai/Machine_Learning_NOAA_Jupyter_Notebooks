# Machine_Learning_Tutorial_Op_Meterology



• The Jupyter Notebooks in this repository are created as one of the tasks in my Intership at the North Carolina Institute for Climate Studies. The purpose of these Jupyter notebooks is to assist researchers and scientists in the development of scientific tools and applications  for the study of large amounts of meteorological data on open-source cloud platforms.



• The "Machine_Learning_Tutorial_Op_Meterology" notebook is designed to detect thunderstroms using classic Logistic Regression technique from the "SEVIR" -"Storm Events Identified by Images and Recognition," which is a freely accessible collection of more than 180,000 annotated photographs of severe weather and the associated meteorological data that were obtained from different weather satellites in the United States. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) generated the dataset to aid in studies on automated severe weather detection and forecasting.



• The dataset contains the following attributes:

• Similarly, "Decision_Tree_Machine_Learning_Tutorial_Op_Meterology" and "Random_Forest_Machine_Learning_Tutorial_Op" diversify the approaches in meteorological classification taks by applying Decision trees and Random Forests respectively.



• The performance of the various Machine Learning Algorithms on SEVIR dataset are evaluated by plotting ROC Curves



• Similarly, "Decision_Tree_Machine_Learning_Tutorial_Op_Meterology" and "Random_Forest_Machine_Learning_Tutorial_Op" diversify the approaches in meteorological classification taks by applying Decision trees and Random Forests respectively.


• ROC Curve for classic Logistic Regression:
